Using ML methods to detect cell segmentation quality of digital microscope images

High-content screening (HCS) is an important tool for clinical disease research and diagnosis. HCS relies on advanced technology and machine learning algorithms to produce accurate and useable results. A common and unavoidable issue in HCS analysis is poor cell segmentation during digital microscopy analysis part of the method. in this paper, we explored different machine learning techniques to identify a model that could be useful in identifying these poorly segmented images in hopes of increasing downstream analysis accuracy. Our results showed that simple regression techniques were not useful in creating such a prediction model. However, we were able to produce models with high accuracy and effectiveness with more advanced modeling techniques such as Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. These methods could provide an effective way to increase the accuracy of HCS analysis.
